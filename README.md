# 3D Object Renderer
This program uses **qt** libraries to generate 3D objects on screen without using the openGL library. Objects are described by a custom language. 

## Further Information 
All rendering algorithms are located in the LineDrawer.cpp, and samples of the custom language can be found in the Custom_language_samples directory. 

## Compile Instructions 
The linux environment is recommended, and this program can only be built with the gcc compiler.
